what is OOPS
 
object oriented programming language oops mainly works on classes and objects

important concepts of oops
class
objects
Inheritance:its provides the reusability
polymorphism: this is all about behaviour in multiple ways
abstraction: Hiding the complexity and provide with a set of interfaces the functionalities
methods are good example for abstractions
encapsulation:hiding the date by wrapping them under a container known as class

what is class

class is collection of data members and memberfunction like blue print

object :is the instace the of the class .It allocated the memory to access the members of class

classname objectname  =  new classname


what are naming convensions of class

we connot create the class name with number
we connot use special character
but we can use thee class_employee

by default

 public class program
{
 public int age = 20;
}

program obj = new program();

by default class in internal

5types of access modifiers
public access any where
private access with in the class same class only
internal: same project only , same dll, same library, with in the project (by creating instance we connot access but creating inheritance its accessable)
protected: under a class can be accessed only from their child class i.e non-child class can't consume them.
protected internal will dual scope :

in same project we can access the the pro internal member by creating the object as well as by child class
