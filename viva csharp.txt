What is C sharp?
 c sharp is an object oriented programming language developed by m/s

Diff b/w C++ and C sharp

CSharp: c sharp is higher level programming language similar to java
------
C++	: C++ low level programming language it is not similar to java
-------

Class: is collection of Data members and member functions
----
String:Belongs to system namesapace 
------
 string s = "shekar";
s= string.Concat(s,"Goud")

String Builder Belongs to System.text namespace
--------------
Stringbuilder sb = new stringbuilder();
sb.Append("shekar");
sb.Append("Goud");

static function
--------------
has the keyword static,it can be accessed without creating object

Sealed class: a Sealed class is a class which cannot be inherited.
------------a sealed class is a public as well as private


public class A
 {
  Public void Fun()
  {
   }
}

//cannot derived
 public class B:A
 {
  Public static void Fun()
  {
   }
 }

public class c
 {
  Public static void Fun()
  {
   //Valid
   A.a = new A();
   a.Fun();
   }
 }

internali:
---------

An internal class ia class which cannot be used outside its Assembly

internal Class a
{
 public void Fun()
 {

  }
}
//Valid
 public class B:A
 {
  Public static void Fun()
  {
   }
  }

public class c
{
 public static void Fun()
 {
  A a = new A();
   a.Fun();
  }
 }  

Abstract class:

An Abstrace class is a special class which is majorly used for inheritance and it cannot be instantited
