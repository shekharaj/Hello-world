Union: This will remove duplicate values
------
The union command is used to select related information from two tables, Which is like a join command
With Union, Only distinct values are selected

union all: This will repeat values,it gives faster result
---------
Union All will not eliminate duplicate values
Example

Table 1 : First,Second,Third,Fourth,Fifth
Table 2 : First,Second,Fifth,Sixth
 
Result Set

UNION: First,Second,Third,Fourth,Fifth,Sixth (This will remove duplicate values)
UNION ALL: First,First,Second,Second,Third,Fourth,Fifth,Fifth,Sixth,Sixth (This will repeat values)
